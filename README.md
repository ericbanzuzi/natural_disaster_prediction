# EmDat Saves the Day: Predicting Natural Disasters

## Project Overview

A small course project studying natural disasters. 

**Course:** Data Analysis (KEN3450)

**Institution:** Maastricht University

### Explored Research Questions
1. How has the frequency and severity of natural disasters changed over time?

2. Can we predict the economic impact and physical damage of natural disasters in the coming years?

3. Can we predict which countries will be affected the most in the coming years?

### Rough Outline of the Analysis

1. Data clean up and Preprocessing
   - handling of missing values in the dataset 
   - selection of features needed for continuation of our analysis
   - simplifying the data structure	 

2. visualization of patterns of the important features

3. prediction task (question 2 and 3)
	- use regression for prediction of impact and severity 
	- use time series forecasting 
	â†’ potentially using monthly or yearly averages
	- compare outcomes of both prediction models
